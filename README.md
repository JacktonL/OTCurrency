### About
OT Currency is a project made for Oakland Tech's 2019 Capstone class
by Clemente Ferrer. It was designed using the Stanford d.school
method of design for future generations of students at Oakland
Tech. It is a website for promoting prosocial behavior in the
community be enabling peers to reward each other for their
actions. It also incentivizes such behavior by giving rewards
to both the recipients and givers of currency. This currency
can then be redeemed for prizes (theoretically when it is put
into action within the school).
